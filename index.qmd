# About This Project

## Heart Disease Prediction

![](images/image-01.webp)

### **Why is Heart Disease Prediction Important?**

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally, impacting millions of lives every year. Prompt diagnosis and accurate prediction of cardiovascular conditions can help in the early treatment of heart diseases, saving lives, improving quality of life, and reducing healthcare costs. Advances in data science, machine learning, and statistics allow us to uncover patterns in medical data and predict heart disease risk effectively.

### **Purpose of the Project**

This project aims to identify the critical factors that increase the likelihood of heart disease and estimate the risks using statistical and machine learning techniques. Our goal is to answer key research questions and provide recommendations for healthcare professionals and policymakers.
