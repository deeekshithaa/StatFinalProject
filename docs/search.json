Research Question 1: Can age, cholesterol levels, and maximum heart rate predict the likelihood of heart disease?\nObjective: It is for this reason that the effectiveness of three physiological measures: age, cholesterol and maximum heart rate for the prediction of heart disease will be compared in this analysis. Using predictive modeling we are able to foresee different prospects and threats that often lead to heart diseases.\nMethods Used: From age, cholesterol levels, and maximum heart rate. Model performance was evaluated on a training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets. We assessed the model’s feature importance and visualize the predicted probabities to gain an understanding of what the model is predicting.\nKey Results: The Random Forest model got 83.33% of accuracy on the testing data, achieving good classifying heart disease on a data set.

Research Question 3: What is the combined effect of resting blood pressure and cholesterol levels on the likelihood of heart disease?\nObjective: In this analysis the combined effect of resting blood pressure (BP) and cholesterol levels on the likelihood of heart disease is analyzed. Understanding this relationship, health care providers can better know the interactions of the physiological factors that predict heart disease risk.\nMethods Used: Resting blood pressure and cholesterol levels were used as predictors in a fitted logistic regression model to see whether heart disease was present. The model produced p values, confidence intervals and predicted probabilities. Blood pressure and cholesterol that were in clinically relevant ranges were assessed for their joint effect. Finally, we visualized the predicted likelihood of heart disease across combinations of BP and cholesterol categories with a heatmap.\nKey Results: An analysis with logistic regression model confirmed significant combined effect of resting BP and cholesterol values on heart disease likelihood (p &lt;. 05 for both predictors).

As with every model, the model uses some key features like age, cholesterol and maximum heart rate to make its predictions.\nFactors Affecting Predictions: It uses information like chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, exercise induced angina, and others to estimate your risk of having heart disease. These variables are informative variables that tell about the current status of this individual’s health.\nUser Interaction: Through a user friendly interface the app allows users to input their health metrics. Once the values have been entered the app tells the user whether they are at risk of heart disease. The outputs are shown immediately for easy interpretation."

The model produced p values, confidence intervals and predicted probabilities. Blood pressure and cholesterol that were in clinically relevant ranges were assessed for their joint effect. Finally, we visualized the predicted likelihood of heart disease across combinations of BP and cholesterol categories with a heatmap.\nKey Results: An analysis with logistic regression model confirmed significant combined effect of resting BP and cholesterol values on heart disease likelihood (p &lt;. 05 for both predictors). A heatmap showed those with higher BP and cholesterol levels had higher predicted likelihood of heart disease.\nVisualization:\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n\nWarning: package 'dplyr' was built under R version 4.4.2\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:randomForest':\n\n    combine\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(plotly)\n\ndata$target &lt;- factor(data$target, levels = c(0, 1))\n\nlogistic_model &lt;- glm(target ~ resting_bp + cholestrol, \n                      data = data, \n                      family = binomial(link = \"logit\"))\n\nsummary(logistic_model)\n\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = target ~ resting_bp + cholestrol, family = binomial(link = \"logit\"), \n    data = data)\n\nCoefficients:\n              Estimate Std.
