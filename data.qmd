## Dataset Description

The information dataset analyzed in this project offers risks of heart disease factors and patientsâ€™ patterns. It is in numerical and categorical forms, such that it is well suited for statistical as well as machine learning analysis.

### Key Features:

-   **Age** *(Numerical)*: Patient age, ranging from 28 to 77.
-   **Cholesterol** *(Numerical)*: Cholesterol levels (mg/dL).
-   **Maximum Heart Rate** *(Numerical)*: Highest heart rate achieved during exercise.
-   **Chest Pain Type** *(Categorical)*:
    -   0: Typical Angina
    -   1: Atypical Angina
    -   2: Non-Anginal Pain
    -   3: Asymptomatic
-   **Resting Blood Pressure** *(Numerical)*: Systolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
-   **Heart Disease** *(Binary)*: Target variable (0: No Heart Disease, 1: Heart Disease Present).

### Data Overview:

-   **Rows (Records):** 1179
-   **Columns (Features):** 12

### Data Cleaning:

-   Handled missing values using mean/mode imputation.
-   Removed duplicate records.
-   Standardized numerical columns and encoded categorical variables.

This dataset forms the basis for exploring relationships and patterns to predict heart disease risk effectively.

### Basic Visualizations

```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)      # For data visualization
library(rpart)        # For decision trees (optional, not used directly here)
library(rpart.plot)   # For plotting decision trees (optional, not used directly here)
library(caret)        # For model evaluation (e.g., confusion matrix, accuracy)
library(readxl)       # For reading Excel files
library(e1071)         # For SVM and other machine learning models (optional, not used directly here)
```

```{r}
# Load the dataset from an Excel file
data <- read_excel("data.xlsx")

# View the cleaned dataset to ensure it's in the correct format
head(data)
```



```{r}
colnames(data)
```



```{r}
#Age Distribution
ggplot(data, aes(x = age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Age Distribution", x = "Age", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

```


```{r}
#max heart rate distribution
ggplot(data, aes(x = max_heartrate)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "lightcoral", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Maximum Heart Rate Distribution", x = "Maximum Heart Rate", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()
